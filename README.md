# ecovacs-privacy-control
Privacy first API control for Ecovacs MQTT based vaccums -- tested with Ecovacs Deebot 900/901 series _only_

Goal: Control Ecovacs MQTT based vaccum robots directly with a self-hosted local API.

## Usage

- Setup WIFI credentials on robot with Ecovacs app
- Build/Run Docker container - Must expose container port 8883
- Point DNS for `ecouser.net` to server running container
- Restart robot -- Robot caches DNS response and to get a refreshed DNS you must restart

If the bot is successful in connecting, you should see something like this in the logs:

```
1637629641: New connection from <snip> on port 8883.
1637629641: New client connected from <snip> as <snip>-<snip>-<snip>-<snip>-<snip>@ls1ok3/<snip> (p2, c1, k120, u'<snip>').
```
## API

`:8000/getMapData` will return the stored map

## TODO:

- Create MQTT Broker with TLS config needed for bot to connect to local server ✅
- Document MQTT message schema/contents for sending bot commands ⚠ (WIP)
- Document MQTT message schema/content for receiving bot info ⚠ (WIP)
- Create local API to send/read MQTT messages ⚠ (WIP)

## Technicials

Once setup, MQTT based Ecovacs robot vaccums directly connect to `mq-ww.ecouser.net`:8883 MQTT server. With a proper DNS setup and a self signed cert for `ecouser.net`, users can redirect bot MQTT traffic to a self-hosted MQTT server

ecovacs-privacy-control is a docker container that generates self-signed certificates for `ecouser.net` and launches Mosquitto (MQTT broker)


### MQTT Communication
Topic Level Variables (Unique per device)
- `$bot_serial` - This is the bots unique serial - format looks something like this `b11fceaf-5173-4190-be6e-9c37ef3dc238`
- `$device_type` - This is the type of bot - format looks something like this `ls1ok3`, `131`, or `Deepo9`
- `$resource` - This is unique to the bot? The format on mine looks like `zwzq`
- `$x` - Any string (for publishing messages for the bot to react to)

Payload XML elements
- `ts` - timestamp
- `td` - functionality

|-|-|-|-|-|-|

## Map Decoding Notes

- MapP topic contains an element `p` which contains a base64 encoded string
    - `p` is decoded from base64 into a byte array
    - a ByteArrayInputStream is created off of the resulting byte array
        - The first 5 bytes are placed into a variable called "props"
        - the next 4 are placed into a variable called "length"
        (to be continued)

## Limitations

WIFI credentials must be setup on the robot with the Ecovacs app. Reverse engineering is required here. To avoid data leakage, internet data can be disabled while setting up bot.
